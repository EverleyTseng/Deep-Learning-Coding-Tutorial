# Neural Networks and Deep Learning — Coding Tutorials (Spring 2025)

This repository is created by Everley Tseng. It contains a series of hands-on coding tutorials developed for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course offered in Spring 2025 at the University of Colorado Boulder.

These tutorials complement the course material with practical exercises in PyTorch, focusing on key concepts such as model training, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, and transformer-based architectures.

## Tutorials Overview

Below is a list of all the tutorials included in this repository:

- Tutorial 1 – Neural Networks and PyTorch
- Tutorial 2 – Model Training and Evaluation
- Tutorial 3 – Training Diagnosis and Solutions
- Tutorial 4 – Convolutional Neural Networks
- Tutorial 5 – PyTorch Datasets and GPU
- Tutorial 6 – Pretrained Computer Vision Models
- Tutorial 7 – Recurrent Neural Networks
- Tutorial 8 – Natural Language Processing
- Tutorial 9 – Attention Mechanism
- Tutorial 10 – Transformer Models and Hugging Face
- Tutorial 11 – Visual Question Answering and VizWiz Dataset Challenge
- Tutorial 12 – Audio Tasks and CLIP
- Tutorial 13 – Chain of Thought Prompting and Inference Playground
- Tutorial 14 – Foundation Model Tuning
- Tutorial 15 – Acceleration and Optimization in Deep Learning

Each tutorial is provided as a standalone Jupyter Notebook and can be run directly in Google Colab using free CPU/GPU/TPU resources.

## Learning Goals

- Build and train neural networks using PyTorch
- Debug and optimize training performance
- Explore real-world applications in vision, language, and multimodal learning
- Understand transformer models and how to fine-tune them
- Apply responsible AI concepts through VQA and privacy challenges
